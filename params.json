{"name":"Nile","tagline":" A discriminative syntax-based word alignment package for statistical machine translation","body":"### Welcome to the Nile project page\r\nNile is a supervised, discriminative word alignment package that can make use of arbitrary and overlapping features. Our current supplied language-independent featureset enables accurate models of word alignment as tested on Arabic-English and Chinese-English language pairs. You can easily augment training with your own set of features specific to whatever language pair you are working with.\r\n\r\nFor details, see:\r\n* [Feature-Rich Language-Independent Syntax-Based Alignment for Statistical Machine Translation](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D11-1046).
