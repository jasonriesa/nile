svector - sparse vector module for Python
2010 March 17
David Chiang

This is a module for working with vectors that have symbolic names
for dimensions (i.e., foo=1 bar=2 rather than [1,2]) and are
represented sparsely (unset values default to 0 but don't take up
space). They are handy for feature vectors in linear classifiers.

Requires:
  - Python (tested with 2.5.2)
  - Cython (tested with 0.11.2)
  - a C++ compiler

To build:
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

The second command installs svector.so in your default directory for
Python modules. Or instead, you can look for build/lib.*/svector.so
and install it where you like.

Please see svector-example.py for how to use the module.
